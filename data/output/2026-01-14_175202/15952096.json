    "beneficiaries": "al PND Awareness will organise regular workshops both online and in-person to educate parents, families, and communities about Postnatal Depression. These workshops will cover topics including recognising the signs, understanding the causes, and knowing how to seek help for Postnatal Depression. By providing clear, accessible information, we aim to increase awareness and offer support. Community Events: PND Awareness will host community events, such as family fun days and wellbeing classes, where awareness about postnatal depression can be integrated into the activities. Through engaging activities and open discussions, we will create a comfortable environment for people to learn about and discuss their wellbeing. Support Groups: PND Awareness will establish support groups where new parents can come together to share their experiences and receive support. These groups will also serve as a platform for spreading awareness, as participants learn from each other and from the experts who facilitate the sessions. Advocacy and Public Speaking: PND Awareness representatives will engage in public speaking at schools, community centres, and healthcare facilities to raise awareness about Postnatal Depression. By speaking directly to different audiences, we can personalise the message and make a stronger impact. Incorporating Awareness into All Programs: Regardless of the specific topic of a workshop or event, PND Awareness will ensure that there is always a component dedicated to raising awareness about Postnatal Depression and other relevant mental health issues. This holistic approach helps keep the conversation going across all our activities. 2 The community interest test is referred to in section 35 of the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004 and is expanded upon in regulations 3, 4 & 5 of the Regulations. 3 E.g. “the residents of Oldtown” or “those suffering from XYZ disease”.
