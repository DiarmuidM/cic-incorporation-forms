Our mission is to connect children with nature by helping schools make the most of their outdoor spaces so the primary beneficiaries will be the schools’ children who will develop their learning and understanding of the natural world, building life skills and improving their mental and physical wellbeing. It will benefit the staff who will develop their confidence and skills in delivering outdoor learning and the schools themselves whose outdoor spaces will be transformed into classrooms and be better utilised, The impact of the coronavirus pandemic requires all schools to reduce class sizes and enforce. social. distancing, so the use of external spaces to support effective learning is even more imperative. The programme will build a network of Lambeth schools to share learning and information, support each other's initiatives and benefit from the impact that a wider alliance brings. Using local partners and other social enterprises to deliver specific parts of the schools’ programmes will promote these local businesses, expanding their reach by linking them with new customers, and supporting the retaining of skills and resources within the community"
