    "beneficiaries": "young people who are at risk of isolation, antisocial behaviour, violence and adverse mental health. We are specifically looking developing interventions which target both adverse mental health (including depression, anxiety, psychosis, low esteem and confidence) and adverse social health (addiction, aggression and violence, gang affiliation, isolation, risky sexual behaviour, bullying). The interaction between these internal and external factors is complex and most likely to be seen in those young people who are disadvantaged socially, economically, or due to family dysfunction. We aim to provide activities which are rooted in connection to natural environments, activities which involve physical activity, and activities which require peer support and group connection. There will also be a strong emphasis on adventure and exploration. We aim to use the findings of academic psychology and psychotherapy to inform our work. We aim to produce our own research and resources to support the work of existing services and organisations including secondary schools and further education teams"
