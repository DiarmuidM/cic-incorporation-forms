The Aspiring Medic’s Support is an independent widening access project based in London that will support medical school applicants from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. Through various schemes, the project has served and will continue to benefit various members of the community including: - Young people aged 18-21 applying to medical school who have come from socially disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. low income household or benefit payment dependent). Such members of the community will benefit from the extensive mentoring scheme of the project. - Parents of medical school applicants will also benefit from the project. This is because parents from lower socioeconomic classes are less likely to be well connected to the clinicians and health professionals that support their child’s application. The Aspiring Medic’s Support addresses this asymmetric information and closes the gap through closely working with the families of applicants. - School staff and younger students (11-16) will also benefit.
