Some schools take Sex and Relationship Education very serrously and really develop awareness in the subject, but other schools only touch on the basics and young people are lacking in the skills to develop good healthy relationships. Inspiring Healthy Choices can offer schools and other organisations that do not have the resources to deliver sex and relationship education the opportunity to make sure young people have ail the knowledge they need to help them make the best choices"
