## SECTION B: Community Interest Statement - Activities & Related Benefit

Please indicate how it is proposed that the company's activities will benefit the community, or a section of the community. Please provide as much detail as possible to enable the CIC Regulator to make an informed decision about whether your proposed company is eligible to
become a community interest company. It would be useful if you were to explain how you think your company will be different from a commercial company providing similar services or products for individual or personal gain.

| Activities (Tell us here what the company is being set up to do) | How will the activity benefit the community? (The community will benefit by...) |
|------|-------|
| **Providing dance activities with a strong community focus.** | There is a lack of community projects across London that young people can get involved in who will benefit from a safe environment where they can interact with others from their community through a fitness activity. The company will provide credited & unaccredited job enhancing opportunities for our members to tackle youth unemployment. |
| **Providing local (classes, competitions, training, fitness, theatre productions, touring)** | Our service will provide a platform for those in the community to participate or view the work that has been created through small showcases to large festivals. We hope that the majority of our members are residents of the platform created with in their area. We would also hope this reduces the level of any anti-social behaviour and improve fitness of those engaging in our services. |
